# ‚ÄºÔ∏è Attention :
This project is far from dead, but it requires revision...
A new bootloader will be utilized for execution on 64-bit architecture. Additionally, new functionalities will be implemented:
- An integrated file system implementation supporting FAT32, NTFS, ext-versions, and much more.
- Multitasking extension for running many subprograms simultaneously.
- Extendable hardware driver slots for multitasking capability.
- An API for accessing all public kernel functionalities.
- A graphical user interface (possibly as a separate threading application).
Many modern features will follow, but please be patient...

## Introduction :
<img align="right" src="https://wiki.freepascal.org/images/9/92/built_with_fpc_logo.png">
FPOS is a operating system consists of a minimal kernel built on FreePascal. It contains a Scheme implementation of a hard drive (ATA) driver, keyboard (PS2), serial (8250 UART), FAT32 filesystem and a small real time clock manager. The project was built to experiment with developement of operating system using a high level functional language to study the developement process and the use of Scheme to build a fairly complex system.

## :heavy_check_mark: Implemented :
- [x] GDT, IDT       ( no problem... I hope )
- [x] ISR            ( currently, only page fault has additional handler )
- [x] IRQ            ( no problem... I hope  )
- [x] Console        ( including simple command processing )
- [x] Keyboard       ( try to be US-std, but I don't know the keymap. Just guessing for now )
- [x] Memory Manager ( needs testing )
- [x] Speaker        ( just for fun :-) )
- [x] RTC            ( seems wrong at PM, also for DayOfWeek )
- [ ] System calls
- [ ] Multitasking
- [ ] Filesystem     ( perhaps FAT12 is the most obvious, or should we create one ourselves? )

## üîß Fixed :
- Successive Write(Ln) fails due to 103 IOResult
- Some inline assembler and assembler routines are missing register list, causing it to crash randomly (please test)

## üìã Changed :
- Updated to FPC RTL revision 14499

## ‚ûï Added :
- Not üìÖ planned for now

## üìù Note :
- Some files are not used due to unusability ( multitasking & filesystem )

# ‚öôÔ∏è How to compile :
- Make sure you have working FPC installation ( try using latest 2.5.x snapshot if your version fails )
- Copy executables** under tools to a directory listed in your PATH ( or Path )
- Open Command Prompt ( start->run->cmd ), cd to fpos top directory, then type 'make'

## :battery: How to test :
- Adapt **(Qemu or Bochs).bat** to your Qemu / Bochs installation
- On Linux, you must change 'i386-linux-ld' in make.rules to 'ld'
